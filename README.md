This repository is mostly for my convenience, as I find it nice to have a similar environment on all my Linux boxes. This would normally mean copying a bunch of files from one machine to another, and tracking the various tweaks across machines was becoming a bit hard to manage.

So, I thought, why not upload them onto a Github repo? Any changes can be pushed and then pulled onto all devices. Not sure why I didn't think of this sooner.

You may find some useful things here and there, but a lot of it is strange personal preference stuff. I'm pretty sure that PowerNoises directory is objectively useless, but it is very fun.
